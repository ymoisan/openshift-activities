The common use case is a MinIO test set up using a self-signed certificate but this example uses the internal DNS name of one of the pods where the MinIO service is running (and its exposed `NodePort`), though this is not shown explicitly thanks to `getpass`. Of course, an external IP is necessary for production use. "

    "It may be interesting for users to have a copy of a specific folder in a bucket, as a form of backup or as a way to have access to resources through-the-web (TTW).  The MinIO client (`mc`) allows one to \"[mirror](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc/mc-mirror.html)\" a local directory to a bucket but it is a one-way process and it obviously requires `mc` to be installed.  Although it is fairly easy to do so -- just [download one file](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html#install-mc), make it executable and run it -- there is a more comprehensive solution : [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace), more specifically in our case [s3fs](https://linuxbeast.com/aws-operations/how-to-install-s3fs-and-mount-an-s3-bucket-on-ubuntu-20-04/).<br><br>\n",

This can be especially useful for backing up data, archiving files, or sharing data between different systems. With S3fs, you can interact with S3 as if it were a local file system, making it much easier to automate data transfer and retrieval processes. S3fs is also useful for organizations that use Amazon S3 as their primary storage solution, as it provides a more seamless way to access and manage the data stored there.\n",

The FUSE system can also be used to mount a local directory on Azure object storage, but one must use Microsoft's [blobfuse2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blobfuse2-what-is) to do so."
