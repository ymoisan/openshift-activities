# OpenShift Activities

This repository is based largely on what the [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository.  The way the `vscode` community organizes development is a source of inspiration for us.  In particular we like the way issues are used to track progress instead of more traditional Kanban style dashboards.

## The Repository

This repository is where we develop the our understanding of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) for interacting with and distributing meteorological data. Iterations below point to "high-level" issues that list goals and specific tasks, which are to be annotated as per the legend below.
